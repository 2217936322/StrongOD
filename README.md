# StrongOD

StrongOD is a powerful plugin for ollydbg debugger, it can anti all kinds of debugger detection techniques.

This is the source code of the StrongOD driver which was reversed by me years ago, for more information, please visit: http://bbs.pediy.com/thread-188275.htm.

Forgive me for not a very good coding style.

**Actually you can combine this driver to any windows debugger, all you need to do is to write a debugger plugin to call interfaces provided by this driver.**
